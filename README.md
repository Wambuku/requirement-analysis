# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## About the Project

The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## Learning Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:

- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
- Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.

## Requirements

To complete the tasks, learners must:

- Have access to a GitHub account and basic knowledge of creating repositories.
- Be familiar with writing clear, structured markdown files in README.md.
- Understand the SDLC process and the role of requirement analysis in it.
- Have experience with tools like Draw.io or equivalent for creating diagrams.
- Be able to conceptualize and articulate project requirements, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
- Access the case study for reference to the booking management system.

## Key Highlights

- **Real-world Application**: Simulates real-life tasks to provide practical experience.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Covers concepts like requirement gathering, functional vs. non-functional requirements, and use case diagrams.
- **Visual Representations**: Use diagrams for clear illustration of system interactions.
- **Practical Insights**: Emphasizes acceptance criteria and its importance in success.
- **Structured Learning Path**: Tasks build progressively to reinforce concepts.
- **Professional Standards**: Uses industry practices for real-world readiness.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining the expectations of users for a new or modified product. It involves gathering, analyzing, and validating requirements to ensure stakeholders’ needs are met. In the SDLC, it helps establish a clear foundation for design, development, and testing.

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Defines Project Scope**: Prevents scope creep by clearly outlining deliverables.
2. **Aligns with Stakeholders**: Ensures all parties understand the system's purpose.
3. **Reduces Rework**: Helps avoid costly changes later in development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting information from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refining gathered information using interviews, surveys, or workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation**: Structuring requirements into SRS or use cases.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Creating models/diagrams to represent requirements.
- **Requirement Validation**: Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These define what the system should do:

- User registration and login
- Property search and filter
- Booking confirmation
- Payment gateway integration

### Non-functional Requirements

These define how the system should perform:

- Page load time under 2 seconds
- 99.9% system uptime
- Encryption for data security
- Mobile responsiveness

## Use Case Diagrams

Use case diagrams represent the interactions between users and the system. They are useful for identifying all users (actors) and their goals (use cases).

**Benefits:**
- Clarifies system scope
- Easy to communicate with stakeholders
- Forms the basis for test cases

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, customer, or other stakeholders.

**Importance:**
- Ensures clear expectations
- Guides development and testing
- Prevents misunderstandings

**Example (Checkout Feature):**
- Given a user selects a property and a date,
- When they click on the checkout button,
- Then the system should prompt for payment and confirm the booking.
